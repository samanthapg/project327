Project Overvew:

Our project consisted of making an IOS app that allowed users to get the safest route back to their homes. The targetted audience for this app is mainly women, college students, and tourists that are in a foreign country. The app would prompt the user for their name, and address, and the user would be able to see on a map the directions and the ETA to their destination. We also have a feature that asks the user every 5 minutes if they are okay, if the user fails to reply to that pop up notif for a certain amount of time, the app will automatically contact the police and share the user's location with them. The app also includes a Notify the police button in case the user is unable to speak on the phone.

How to 'build' project:

First - Xcode must be downloaded to your device

Second - Download the latest .zip file of SafeWalk.zip and extract it

Third - In the folder open the SafeWalk.xcodeproj

Fourth - Xcode should load, then hit run to execute the simulator

Fifth - Enjoy our App!

Note - To appropiately run our app and get the notifying a person or authority feature, an 
        Iphone with the latest IOS Software Uptade is needed. 

How we built the project:

Since we are designing an IOS app, the language we decided to go with is Swift, and we are designing our project on Xcode. Xcode is one of the best IDEs to develop IOS apps. By taking advantage of all the design features, it is easier for us to direcly use the story board features which allows us to add occurences on the app layout and connect them to the code easily. This came in handy when we implemented the MapKit feature that gave us access to the Apple Maps IPA. 

The group was divided into two, one that focuses on the user inteface and the other on the map. After each group completed their respective goals and code, the next step was to implement the map design with the UI and make our tabbed application function accordingly.
