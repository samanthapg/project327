Project Overvew:
Our project consisted of making an IOS app that allowed users to get the safest route back to their homes. The targetted audience for this app is mainly women, college students, and tourists that are in a foreign country. The app would prompt the user for their name, and address, and the user would be able to see on a map the directions and the ETA to their destination. We also have a feature that asks the user every little while if they are okay, if the user fails to reply to that pop up notif for a certain amount of time, the app will automatically contact the police and share the user's location with them. The app also includes a Notify the police button in case the user is unable to speak on the phone.


How we built the project:
Since we are designing an IOS app, the language we decided to go with is Swift, and we are designing our project on Xcode. Xcode is one of the best IDEs to develop IOS apps. By taking advantage of all the design features, it is easier for us to direcly use the story board feature which allows us to add occurences on the app layout and connect to the code easily. This came in handy when we implemented the MapKit feature that gave us access to the Apple Maps. 
Basically, we divided the work in two parts, the user interface, and the map. the group was divided and each subgroup worked on either or. The next step is to implement the map design with the UI and make our tabbed application function accordingly.
